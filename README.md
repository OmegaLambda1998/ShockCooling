# ShockCooling.jl
A general purpose Shock Cooling Lightcurve (SCL) fitter. Makes use of my [Supernovae](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Supernovae) package to read in supernova lightcurve data. You can then specify the SCL model as well as MCMC fitting parameters. After the fits, analysis and plotting is performed.

Documentation and tutorial to come, for the moment check out the example input files in `Examples/Inputs`. These can be called via `./scripts/ShockCooling Examples/Inputs/...`.
